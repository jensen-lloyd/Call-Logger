- [ ] Inbuilt templates to read/copy from which have fields e.g. ```{name}``` that will autofill with the team member's name, or global fields such as ```{laptop-silver-price}``` that can be edited in the admin panel.
For local fields such as ```{client-name}```, a text box will open when copied to directly type in their name without having to paste, then edit the text in place
The templates can be used to save time on common responses, as well as standardise terminology and processes across a team.
